Objectives
Ocsigen allows you to manage every aspect of Web app programming, and to create
client-server websites and applications. For a gentle start, this project will help you
discover client-side programming with the library Eliom and the compiler Js_of_ocaml,
and will teach you to:
1. Run an OCaml program in a web browser thanks to the Ocsigen compiler. Js_of_ocaml
;
2. Statically validate the HTML pages that you generate to prevent your program from
creating invalid pages;
3. interact with the browser’s DOM and call Javascript methods thanks to the OCaml
program;
4. program handlers for mouse events;
5. program cooperative threads in monadic style with Ocsigen Lwt.

Chapter IV
General instructions
The project will be entirely programmed with the latest version of OCaml, the Js_of_ocaml
compiler and the Eliom library of the Ocsigen project. You will also need the latest ver-
sion available.
You will find the Ocsigen documentation on the project website. Take the time to
read the tutorials before starting.
• Each Creet must be commanded by a Lwt thread.
• It will be displayed as a DOM element (a <div> or <img> for instance).
• Mouse events must be programmed with the Lwt_js_event module of Js_of_ocaml.
You will find examples of this module in tutorials on the Ocsigen website.
Advice:
• Keep your browser debugging tools handy;
• Read the Ocsigen tutorials.

Chapter V
Mandatory part
Creets must move randomly on a rectangular space of the browser’s window, bordered
by a toxic river on top and a hospital where the sick Creets will get healed on the bottom.
Unlucky Creets that will touch the river will get sick. If so, they change color, become
contagious and contaminate the ones they touch with a probability.
The goal of the game is to last as long as possible before all the unlucky Creets get
contaminated. When this happens, the game is over.
• Creets reproduce spontaneously as long as one healthy Creet is left. As long as
they stay healthy, they never die.
• User must be able to grab-move Creets with the mouse to keep them away from
the river and take the sick ones to the hospital.
• A sick Creet that randomly touches the hospital won’t be healed. Only the ones
the user has taken to the hospital will be.
• When a Creet is grabbed by the user, it becomes “invulnerable” and cannot be
contaminated if it’s healthy.
• A Creet moves in straight lines but might randomly change direction. These unex-
pected changes must not happen too often to help the player plan the Creets’ path,
but still create surprise somehow.
• A Creet that touches the edges of the game area rebounds realistically, whichever
edge it is.
• A Creet that gets contaminated instantly changes color and gets 15% slower.
• A contaminated Creet that touches a healthy Creet has a 2% risk of contaminating
it at each iteration. There is no collision ("no rebound"); Creets walk over each
other.
• A Creet that gets sick has a 10% risk of becoming berserk! In that case, the Creet’s
color changes from the contaminated one, and its diameter slowly grows until it has
quadrupled by the end of its life, making it more likely to contaminate others, etc.

• Also, a Creet that gets contaminated has a 10% risk of becoming mean! When
this happens, the Creet gets a different color from the contaminated Creets and the
Berserks. It shrinks 15% smaller than its regular size but starts running after the
other healthy Creets to contaminate them willingly! Nasty little Creet!
• A contaminated Creet cannot be both Berserk and mean.
• Because of the panic, Creets accelerate in time so the difficulty level increases along
until the player gets overwhelmed ... and loses. You’re free to set the balance as
you see fit. The game should be very easy at first and grow harder with time. The
player should feel confident in the beginning, until the game turns into a nightmare
demanding relentless clicking skills.
• You will choose the number of Creets according to the size you will give them to
offer a balanced playability and a clear display. Very small Creets, for instance,
would probably make the game a little dull.
• You can adapt the instructed probabilities if and only if you feel like it will help
the balance of the game without changing its nature.
• When no living or healthy Creet is left, the game stops with a displayed GAME
OVER message

Chapter VI
Bonus part
• Try to make your game graphically pleasant;
• Implement a way to control the simulation parameters with various forms, cursors
or checkboxes on the page;
• Optimize the collision detection between the Creets using a quadtree for instance.
