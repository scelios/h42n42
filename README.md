# h42n42
For millenia, Creatures have lived in a peaceful land bordered by a river. Unfortunately,
the river has been polluted by H42N42, a deadly and very infectious virus for some time.
The Creatures will not survive without your assistance! Your goal will be to help them
stay away from the river and to bring the sick ones to the hospital where they will be
healed so they don’t contaminate the others.
In this project, we have an interactive simulator of this Creature world with a
Web UI written in OCaml on the client side.
